DiskTrim 1.0 by Antoni Sawicki and Tomasz Nowak
Requires Windows 2008 R2 / Windows 8.1 or above

DiskTrim is a small command line application for Windows that allows
to send  ATA TRIM / SCSI UNMAP command directly to an SSD using SCSI
pass through. It functionis to securely erase contents of an SSD and
test whether TRIM actually worked.  If you just want to test if your
SSD supports TRIM under Windows without deleting it's contents,  you
can create and mount a small VHDX file and run DiskTrim on the  VHDX
instead of physical disk.
